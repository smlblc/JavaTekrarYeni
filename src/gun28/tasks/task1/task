create class ElectricityAccount with attributes:

create class Task1, and create a Customer with all attributes and print/debug;

create method in Customer as "consumeElectricity" with parameter as (wph)
every time when customer consumes electricity, it should add to totalWph
//ex: customer.consumeElectricity(100);
      customer.consumeElectricity(200);
      customer.consumeElectricity(50);

   // totalWph = 350 ?

create method in ElectricityAccount that calculates bill
